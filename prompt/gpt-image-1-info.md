A tour of image-related use cases

Recent language models can process image inputs and analyze them — a capability known as vision. With gpt-image-1, they can both analyze visual inputs and create images.

The OpenAI API offers several endpoints to process images as input or generate them as output, enabling you to build powerful multimodal applications.

API	Supported use cases
Responses API	Analyze images and use them as input and/or generate images as output
Images API	Generate images as output, optionally using images as input
Chat Completions API	Analyze images and use them as input to generate text or audio
To learn more about the input and output modalities supported by our models, refer to our models page.

Generate or edit images

You can generate or edit images using the Image API or the Responses API.

Our latest image generation model, gpt-image-1, is a natively multimodal large language model. It can understand text and images and leverage its broad world knowledge to generate images with better instruction following and contextual awareness.

In contrast, we also offer specialized image generation models - DALL·E 2 and 3 - which don’t have the same inherent understanding of the world as GPT Image.

Generate images with Responses
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

client = OpenAI() 

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input="Generate an image of gray tabby cat hugging an otter with an orange scarf",
    tools=[{"type": "image_generation"}],
)

// Save the image to a file
image_data = [
    output.result
    for output in response.output
    if output.type == "image_generation_call"
]

if image_data:
    image_base64 = image_data[0]
    with open("cat_and_otter.png", "wb") as f:
        f.write(base64.b64decode(image_base64))
You can learn more about image generation in our Image generation guide.

Using world knowledge for image generation

The difference between DALL·E models and GPT Image is that a natively multimodal language model can use its visual understanding of the world to generate lifelike images including real-life details without a reference.

For example, if you prompt GPT Image to generate an image of a glass cabinet with the most popular semi-precious stones, the model knows enough to select gemstones like amethyst, rose quartz, jade, etc, and depict them in a realistic way.

Analyze images

Vision is the ability for a model to “see” and understand images. If there is text in an image, the model can also understand the text. It can understand most visual elements, including objects, shapes, colors, and textures, even if there are some limitations.

Giving a model images as input

You can provide images as input to generation requests in multiple ways:

By providing a fully qualified URL to an image file
By providing an image as a Base64-encoded data URL
By providing a file ID (created with the Files API)
You can provide multiple images as input in a single request by including multiple images in the content array, but keep in mind that images count as tokens and will be billed accordingly.

Passing a URL
Passing a Base64 encoded image
Passing a file ID
Analyze the content of an image
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1-mini",
    input=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "input_text", "text": "what's in this image?"},
            {
                "type": "input_image",
                "image_url": "https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a2e6da57-3cd1-4235-b20e-95dcaefed6c8/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg",
            },
        ],
    }],
)

print(response.output_text)
Image input requirements

Input images must meet the following requirements to be used in the API.

Supported file types	
PNG (.png) - JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg) - WEBP (.webp) - Non-animated GIF (.gif)
Size limits	
Up to 50 MB total payload size per request - Up to 500 individual image inputs per request
Other requirements	
No watermarks or logos - No NSFW content - Clear enough for a human to understand
Choose an image detail level

The detail parameter tells the model what level of detail to use when processing and understanding the image (low, high, original, or auto to let the model decide). If you skip the parameter, the model will use auto. This behavior is the same in both the Responses API and the Chat Completions API.

{
    "type": "input_image",
    "image_url": "https://api.nga.gov/iiif/a2e6da57-3cd1-4235-b20e-95dcaefed6c8/full/!800,800/0/default.jpg",
    "detail": "original"
}
Use the following guidance to choose a detail level:

Detail level	Best for
"low"	Fast, low-cost understanding when fine visual detail is not important. The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image.
"high"	Standard high-fidelity image understanding.
"original"	Large, dense, spatially sensitive, or computer-use images. Available on gpt-5.4 and future models.
"auto"	Let the model choose the detail level.
For computer use, localization, and click-accuracy use cases on gpt-5.4 and future models, we recommend "detail": "original". See the Computer use guide for more detail.

Read more about how models resize images in the Model sizing behavior section, and about token costs in the Calculating costs section below.

Model sizing behavior

Different models use different resizing rules before image tokenization:

Model family	Supported detail levels	Patch and resizing behavior
gpt-5.4 and future models

low, high, original, auto

high allows up to 2,500 patches or a 2048-pixel maximum dimension. original allows up to 10,000 patches or a 6000-pixel maximum dimension. If either limit is exceeded, we resize the image while preserving aspect ratio to fit within the lesser of those two constraints for the selected detail level. Full resizing details below.

gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5.2, gpt-5.3-codex, gpt-5-codex-mini, gpt-5.1-codex-mini, gpt-5.2-codex, gpt-5.2-chat-latest, o4-mini, and the gpt-4.1-mini and gpt-4.1-nano 2025-04-14 snapshot variants

low, high, auto

high allows up to 1,536 patches or a 2048-pixel maximum dimension. If either limit is exceeded, we resize the image while preserving aspect ratio to fit within the lesser of those two constraints. Full resizing details below.

GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, computer-use-preview, and o-series models except o4-mini

low, high, auto

Use tile-based resizing behavior. See

the detailed behavior below

Calculating costs

Image inputs are metered and charged in token units similar to text inputs. How images are converted to text token inputs varies based on the model. You can find a vision pricing calculator in the FAQ section of the pricing page.

Patch-based image tokenization

Some models tokenize images by covering them with 32px x 32px patches. Each model defines a maximum patch budget. The token cost of an image is determined as follows:

A. Compute how many 32px x 32px patches are needed to cover the original image. A patch may extend beyond the image boundary.

original_patch_count = ceil(width/32)×ceil(height/32)
B. If the original image would exceed the model’s patch budget, scale it down proportionally until it fits within that budget. Then adjust the scale so the final resized image stays within budget after converting to integer pixel dimensions and computing patch coverage.

shrink_factor = sqrt((32^2 * patch_budget) / (width * height))
adjusted_shrink_factor = shrink_factor * min(
  floor(width * shrink_factor / 32) / (width * shrink_factor / 32),
  floor(height * shrink_factor / 32) / (height * shrink_factor / 32)
)
C. Convert the adjusted scale into integer pixel dimensions, then compute the number of patches needed to cover the resized image. This resized patch count is the image-token count before applying the model multiplier, and it is capped by the model’s patch budget.

resized_patch_count = ceil(resized_width/32)×ceil(resized_height/32)
D. Apply a multiplier based on the model to get the total tokens:

Model	Multiplier
gpt-5-mini	1.62
gpt-5-nano	2.46
gpt-4.1-mini*	1.62
gpt-4.1-nano*	2.46
o4-mini	1.72
For gpt-4.1-mini and gpt-4.1-nano, this applies to the 2025-04-14 snapshot variants.

Cost calculation examples for a model with a 1,536-patch budget

A 1024 x 1024 image has a post-resize patch count of 1024
A. original_patch_count = ceil(1024 / 32) * ceil(1024 / 32) = 32 * 32 = 1024
B. 1024 is below the 1,536 patch budget, so no resize is needed.
C. resized_patch_count = 1024
Resized patch count before the model multiplier: 1024
Multiply by the model’s token multiplier to get the billed token units.
A 1800 x 2400 image has a post-resize patch count of 1452
A. original_patch_count = ceil(1800 / 32) * ceil(2400 / 32) = 57 * 75 = 4275
B. 4275 exceeds the 1,536 patch budget, so we first compute shrink_factor = sqrt((32^2 * 1536) / (1800 * 2400)) = 0.603.
We then adjust that scale so the final integer pixel dimensions stay within budget after patch counting: adjusted_shrink_factor = 0.603 * min(floor(1800 * 0.603 / 32) / (1800 * 0.603 / 32), floor(2400 * 0.603 / 32) / (2400 * 0.603 / 32)) = 0.586.
Resized image in integer pixels: 1056 x 1408
C. resized_patch_count = ceil(1056 / 32) * ceil(1408 / 32) = 33 * 44 = 1452
Resized patch count before the model multiplier: 1452
Multiply by the model’s token multiplier to get the billed token units.
Tile-based image tokenization

GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4o-mini, CUA, and o-series (except o4-mini)

The token cost of an image is determined by two factors: size and detail.

Any image with "detail": "low" costs a set, base number of tokens. This amount varies by model. To calculate the cost of an image with "detail": "high", we do the following:

Scale to fit in a 2048px x 2048px square, maintaining original aspect ratio
Scale so that the image’s shortest side is 768px long
Count the number of 512px squares in the image. Each square costs a set amount of tokens, shown below.
Add the base tokens to the total
Model	Base tokens	Tile tokens
gpt-5, gpt-5-chat-latest	70	140
4o, 4.1, 4.5	85	170
4o-mini	2833	5667
o1, o1-pro, o3	75	150
computer-use-preview	65	129
GPT Image 1

For GPT Image 1, we calculate the cost of an image input the same way as described above, except that we scale down the image so that the shortest side is 512px instead of 768px. The price depends on the dimensions of the image and the input fidelity.

When input fidelity is set to low, the base cost is 65 image tokens, and each tile costs 129 image tokens. When using high input fidelity, we add a set number of tokens based on the image’s aspect ratio in addition to the image tokens described above.

If your image is square, we add 4160 extra input image tokens.
If it is closer to portrait or landscape, we add 6240 extra tokens.

Limitations

While models with vision capabilities are powerful and can be used in many situations, it’s important to understand the limitations of these models. Here are some known limitations:

Medical images: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn’t be used for medical advice.
Non-English: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
Small text: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability. When available, using "detail": "original" can also help performance.
Rotation: The model may misinterpret rotated or upside-down text and images.
Visual elements: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles—like solid, dashed, or dotted lines—vary.
Spatial reasoning: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
Accuracy: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
Image shape: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
Metadata and resizing: The model doesn’t process original file names or metadata. Depending on image size and detail level, images may be resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
Counting: The model may give approximate counts for objects in images.
CAPTCHAS: For safety reasons, our system blocks the submission of CAPTCHAs.
